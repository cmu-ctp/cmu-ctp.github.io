## Who We Are

The Center for Transformational Play (CTP) is a research center launched by the Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science to house the research and development of transformational games. We leverage resources across the university and our region to increase their impact through an ecosystem of rich connections. Always expanding the boundaries of what is possible, we build community, do high-quality research, make games, and connect with the world. We provide research-backed solutions to help people solve problems that matter to them through the power of games and play. We aim for our work to be **joyful**, **effective**, and **valuable** to those who engage with it.

### Joyful
Transformational games should be excellent games in their own right. We value the craft and the process of game design and believe making and playing transformational games should be fun, impactful, and rewarding. 

### Effective
Transformational game experiences should be worthwhile, constructive, and fruitful. We integrate research into our work at every stage, from conception to deployment. 

### ...and Valuable
We respect the time of our players, partners, and members. We work in partnership with community stakeholders and honor our players’ needs. 

## What We Do

At the Center for Transformational Play (CTP) we use the power of play to tackle
educational, industrial, and social challenges, from teaching children about
robotics to helping adults with aphasia rehabilitation exercises. Other projects
include playful methods to support climate action, games to help with healthy
sleep, and leveraging game streaming for interactive learning — to give just a few
of our many and diverse interests.

The CTP has the interdisciplinary expertise to connect across the university, including
the educational gaming work at the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu) (HCII)
to the transformational game capstones at the [Entertainment Technology Center](https://www.etc.cmu.edu/)
(ETC). We also collaborate with cutting-edge researchers in computer science,
neuroscience, psychology, drama, and art — all areas where Carnegie Mellon’s
excellence can help us advance our work on transformational play.
