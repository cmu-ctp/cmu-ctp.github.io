# Adding a person

Create a new `*.md` in `_people` with a unique name for you. Then fill it with the following content.

```md
---
name: ...
website: https://example.com | mailto:example@andrew.cmu.edu
image: /assets/people/<FirstLast>.jpg
section: Student | Staff | Student
subtitle: Technical Game Designer
---
```

Use one of these for section:
- Faculty
- Staff
- Student

Add add a picture, add it to [the assets directory](../assets/people) with around `400x400` pixels as a JPEG image.  The height and width of the image should be equal, so it is a square.
