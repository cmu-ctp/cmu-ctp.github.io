Echo of the Abyss is a Virtual Reality (VR) experience that uses animal guides and immersive environments to cultivate a sense of kinship towards marine life. It emphasises the impact of design elements in creating a feeling of interconnectedness and in challenging mainstream perceptions of the deep sea, such as feelings of alienness and fear. Our approach offers design strategies aimed at increasing a feeling of safety and reflecting on the human and more-than-human bodies' relations in the environment.

In collaboration with: Yanick Trindade, Nuno Nunes, Valentina Nisi and the [eGamesLab](https://egameslab.pt/).
