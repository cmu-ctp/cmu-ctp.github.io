**Bloomwood Stories: Block Party** is a visual novel that aims to increase players' health self-efficacy and connect them to health resources at their local library. The player takes the role of a community organizer who, by helping five different characters who face different challenges around health, can make the neighborhood block party the best one ever!

This award-winning game was developed in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health [All of Us](https://allofus.nih.gov/) initiative and Allegheny Health Network. The narrative-driven game is designed to boost health knowledge and self-efficacy among players, particularly those from marginalized communities using an evidence-based model for digitizing and gamifying online health information.

The game designers considered research indicating that certain vulnerable groups face racial and ethnic biases in healthcare, barriers to access, and lower levels of trust in healthcare systems. The design approach considered these populations and effective ways to provide digital interventions at local libraries or online at home.

Throughout the game, players are offered risk/benefit information, skill development, guided practice, and social support in a culturally relevant environment.

In addition to being available through public libraries and *All of Us* Community Engagement Partners, **Bloomwood Stories: Block Party** has also been exhibited at the Harlem Museum of Science.
