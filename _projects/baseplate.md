**Project Baseplate** developed from the Center for Transformational Play’s relationship with UK-Based [Play Included®](https://playincluded.com/) as the only Advanced Facilitator training partner in the United States for the internationally-acclaimed [Brick-by-Brick®](https://playincluded.com/en-gb/the-brick-by-brick-programme?locale=en-GB) program.

Play Included® is the only [The LEGO Foundation®](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lego-foundation/)-supported program which focuses on social and emotional wellbeing.

The [Brick-by-Brick®](https://playincluded.com/en-gb/the-brick-by-brick-programme?locale=en-GB) program creates meaningful, positive experiences for children and youth through collaborative LEGO® building at “Brick Clubs.” The clubs offer a safe, accepting environment where participants can make friends, build confidence, and develop critical social and emotional skills - all while having fun.

**Project Baseplate** is an innovation lab and community hub. The project provides workshops and training to education professionals to deliver the Brick-by-Brick® program in their own schools and in community settings to support development and personal wellbeing.

As of the start of 2025, more than 125 people have been certified through Project Baseplate in the Brick-by-Brick® program, allowing hundreds of students to participate in Brick Clubs. The majority of Brick Clubs are currently based in southwestern Pennsylvania, but clubs have been established across the United States, including in Michigan and Colorado.

In some learning environments, Brick Clubs have gone so well, they've been adapted to serve other demographics, including Brick Clubs for senior citizens.There are undergraduates receiving college credits for being part of a Brick Club and a Brick Club has even been established at the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum! 

**Project Baseplate** has live streamed custom brick builds for Nevada Humanities, designed exercises for the Rhode Island Center for the Book, and has presented at various national conferences and events. 

Project Baseplate has received support from the Richard King Mellon Foundation, the Benedum Foundation, The Grable Foundation, and David L. and Noelle C. Conover of Matt's Maker Space.
