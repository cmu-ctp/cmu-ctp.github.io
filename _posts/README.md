# Adding a post

Create a new `*.md` file in the `_posts` directory with the date and title in the name. Learn more about posts in [the Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).

For examples posts see: https://github.com/cmudig/cmudig.github.io/tree/main/_posts

For posts about opportunities people can get involved with, include an "opportunityLink",
which will then cause that post to show up on the opportunities page.
