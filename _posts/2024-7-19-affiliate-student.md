The CTP affiliate student program is fairly new so we’re still piloting it and collecting feedback. We’ll update this as our program expands and changes.

The Center for Transformational Play has four mission pillars. One is to be a resource of deep expertise on game design and development. Another is to bring people together. This is where you come in.

### Benefits our student affiliates enjoy:

- Acknowledgement on this website
- Credit on your CV
- Access to special CTP office hours from faculty and staff
- Access to RAND space and library during open hours
- Resources for recruiting playtesters for your games
- Early access to job opportunities that pass through the CTP
- Unique opportunities to connect with our partners and funders

### Requirements to join our student affiliate program:

1. You must be a current student in any program at Carnegie Mellon University (special exception can sometimes be made for other universities on request)
2. You must sign our code of conduct (you will be asked to renew this every year) 
3. Because we are inviting you into a community, we give back to one another. You must contribute a minimum of 2 hours per month to playtesting or other CTP activities, both of which will be announced in regular emails.

**If you’re interested, sign up with this [form](https://forms.gle/ucmUy3ug4Dk3bvkk9) and we’ll add you to our program!**

### Frequently Asked Questions:

1. **Do I have to be a game designer?**
  - No. The program is open to anyone with an interest in transformational games. We welcome researchers, designers, programmers, artists, writers, and anyone else who would like to get involved. 
2. **Do I need to be in HCII?** 
  - No. Our student affiliate program is open to any undergraduate, graduate student, or postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University.
3. **Is this program a good fit for me if I want to learn more about game design but am not in a formal program or currently pursuing?** 
  - As an affiliate, you’ll receive invitations to seminars, workshops, and other educational opportunities. You will also be the first to hear about opportunities to work with the CTP. However, we are not a degree program and do not offer courses.
4. **Will this give me keycard access to the lab? If it doesn’t specifically, could I anyway?**
  - Students doing research or design work with the CTP are eligible for keycard access. Our student affiliate program does not provide keycard access to the lab, but you are welcome to join us during open lab hours or for events.
5. **What is the overall time commitment per month?** 
  - We ask for two hours of your time per month, typically spent on playtesting CTP games. You will receive opportunities to playtest through the mailing list. 
6. **What do I get in return?** 
  - You get access to our mailing list, special CTP office hours with faculty and staff, CTP workshops, and more.
7. **I know other people who would like to join the CTP affiliate program. What should I do?**

Our student program is available to all undergraduates, masters students, and doctoral students, as well as to postdoctoral fellows. If they are a faculty member, please have them contact [Avonelle Wing](mailto:agwing@andrew.cmu.edu). We will put them on the list for our next round of onboarding. If they are staff, they should also contact [Avonelle Wing](mailto:agwing@andrew.cmu.edu). We are collecting data on how we can best support staff who want to be involved.
