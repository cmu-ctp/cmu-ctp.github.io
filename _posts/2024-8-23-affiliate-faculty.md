The CTP affiliate student program is fairly new so we’re still piloting it and collecting feedback. We’ll update this as our program expands and changes.

The Center for Transformational Play has four mission pillars. One is to be a resource of deep expertise on game design and development. Another is to bring people together. This is where you come in.

### Frequently Asked Questions:

1. **I know other people who would like to join the CTP affiliate program. What should I do?**
  - If they are a student, let them know about our [affiliated student program](https://ludolab.github.io/2024/07/19/affiliate-student.html) and ask them to contact Elaine Fath. Our student program is available to all undergraduates, masters students, and doctoral students, as well as to postdoctoral fellows. If they are a faculty member, please have them contact [Avonelle Wing](mailto:agwing@andrew.cmu.edu). We will put them on the list for our next round of onboarding. If they are staff, they should also contact Avonelle Wing. We are collecting data on how we can best support staff who want to be involved.
2. **Can someone else in my lab host the required office hours for me?** 
  - Unfortunately, no. Community is made by those who show up. If you are not able to dedicate two hours per month to the CTP, we would be glad to follow up with you when your availability changes.
3. **I’d like to contribute in a different way. What should I do?** 
  - We have limited spots available for talks, workshops, game nights, and other types of contributions. Please reach out to [Avonelle Wing](mailto:agwing@andrew.cmu.edu) if there is something you have in mind.
4. **I have a great idea for the faculty affiliate program! How do I share it?** 
  - Please let us know using our [feedback form](?????????????).
